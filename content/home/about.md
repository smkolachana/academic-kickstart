Sindhura Kolachana is a recent undergraduate and is now working at the Transgenic Core at the National Institutes of Health. She is currently working on characterizing the process of transgenesis in the marmoset monkey in order to produce more reliable transgenic primate models in the future. She is well trained at methods such as blood collection, ultrasound, hormone injections, gamete collection, ELISA, tissue culture, IPSC production, and primate behavioral training. She will be matriculating to medical school in August 2018 where she hopes to continue conducting neuroscience research.
